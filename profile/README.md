# 👋 Welcome to victoriacheng15 Hub

A personal hub for learning and experimenting with reusable GitHub Actions and Platform Engineering concepts.

---

## 🏗️ [platform-actions](https://github.com/victoriacheng15hub/platform-actions)

This is the central engine for my platform engineering experiments. It provides a suite of reusable GitHub Actions built with three core goals in mind:

- **Eliminate Toil:** Automating the "boring" parts of development (like versioning and dependency updates) so I can focus on building.
- **Enforce Governance:** Using automation to maintain high standards for PR titles, commit history, and architectural documentation.
- **Docs as Code:** Treating documentation with the same rigor as code, including automated linting and a versioned decision log.

Every action here is built to be modular, testable, and ready to scale across any project in this hub.
